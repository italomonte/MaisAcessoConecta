# ♿️ Mais Acesso — Connecting People with Disabilities to the Job Market in Amazonas

Did you know that **over 200,000 People with Disabilities (PwD) live in Amazonas**, and **around 66% of them are unemployed?**  
*(Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics — IBGE, 2022)*

To help build a more inclusive job market in Northern Brazil, I worked as a **developer on the Mais Acesso project**, an online platform that connects **companies and PwD candidates**, providing affirmative job openings and accessible candidate profiles.

## 🌱 Impact

Mais Acesso has already achieved meaningful results:

- **250+ registered candidates**
- **170+ affirmative job openings available**
- Featured in **CBN, G1, and TRT-11**
- Connecting real opportunities to people who are often invisible in the job market

Knowing that a platform can truly impact the lives of more than 250 people is surreal — and it motivates every line of code written for this project.
